EliteEstates is a modern real estate web application developed as part of my coursework. The project focuses on building a responsive, user-friendly interface for showcasing property listings using contemporary web development tools and best practices.

The application is built with React.js for creating reusable, component-based user interfaces and Vite for a fast and efficient development environment with optimized build performance. The project emphasizes clean code structure, scalability, and maintainability.

For deployment, Vercel is used to ensure seamless hosting, continuous deployment, and high performance. The platform allows instant updates with every push to the repository and provides a reliable production environment.
